# price_of_a_car
This project is analysis of a dataset of Car Sales. The data is taken from The original dataset is taken from Kaggle. It was trimmed down for better understasnding and processing.
The goal of this project is to analyse the dataset and provide recommendations to used car dealerships on what consumers value in the car. The AI/ML analysis is conducted following CRISP-DM framework.

## Problem Statement
### What do consumers value in a used car?
The dataset contains data about car sales. THis project takes the data through the steps of CRISP-DM and makes recommendations on what factors affect car prices and what factors do consumers value in a car. So that the used car dealerships can make informed decisions on valuing the cars.

The commands and code to manipulate and visualize the data is provided in and Interactive Python Notebook (Jupyter Notebook) in the repository.

## Data Description
The dataset contains :
### 1. User Attributes

### 2. Contextual Attributes

### 3. Coupon Attributes


### Acceptance of coupon Y:  

The dataset is in the `/data` subfolder.
